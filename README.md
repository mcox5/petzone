This app was made in the last week of Lewagon bootcamp as final project.

Petzone is an App that seeks to help pet owners in the storage of files (like vaccines, x-rays, medical stuffs) and generate reminders (future appointments, dewormings or others). This will help pet owners have a better organization and not be worried about where are pet papers.

The software architecture in the project is MVC (Model, View, Controller), which was made on Ruby on Rails.
